** Data Blending
- take two data sources and blend them which is different of joining two tables
  In same data source.

- load sales data
- click on sheet
- Data > new data source > review data
- go to sheet1 you see two data
- Data > edit relation > 
  Make sure primary data source is Sales
  And connections are Audiobook name and transaction id
- Change data type of Date of purchase in sales data
- Again go to connection you will see date of purchase there.

----------------------------------------------
** After blending
- check number of rows in sales data: drag number of records to workspace, agg is sum.
- check number of ratings in review data: drag ratings, change aggregation to count
- When I am in reviews table, draggin rating fails, we need to add the connection.
- Data > edit blend relation > sales purchase year == review review date year
  And also months.


Notes:
In data sales make sure we see red links in Audio name, date of purchase, transaction id
