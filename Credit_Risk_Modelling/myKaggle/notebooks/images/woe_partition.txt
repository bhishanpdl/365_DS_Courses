1. Discrete variables
- Get woe data frame
- sort values by WOE
- Check number count and woe and group them.
- Make separate category for large number column

2. Continuous unique < 200
- If we have about 100 categories, we can see them without binning.
- If more than 100, first categorize the data, eg into 50 bins
- Sort them by value, not by WOE
- Again look at number count and woe to make categories.

3. Continuous 
- example is annual income
- first try 50 bins, we may see low income bins number very high, eg 90%
- then try 100 bins, we may see few bins having large counts
- then break the data into two parts
- create new temp data frame with income below < some_number
- then repeat the usual process of binning
- for annual income, we may create two bins for two edges, then equally split the
  Middle bins.

Notes:
- If we see zigzag woe chart, we should suspect low number of counts
- We can group all low number counts into one single category, or make
  two or three depending how the curve looks.
- If WOE curve is flat, drop the variable from analysis.
